kill and run perl scripts have separate bad nodes lists.

Get 'Isolation (S12)' into TDRSS fitness function (see Goddard related email).

Fix up antenna variables.  They are very unclean in subclass heirarchy.

TechReport for nittin and ankur?
	Extended abstract to tek?

rationalize segment ID numbers (done both when segments created and nec lines generated, should be latter?).
	-- pass in ID and nec counts as parameters instead of keeping in the segment

Setting a different cubesat body in Cubesat*.java is a little crufty.  Done strictly through static and need 3 lines to do properly.

Have WireSegmentList check for crossing wires (endpoints can match, but not both) -- look at Wire.java code at same time


For calculating mean and stddev, allow elimination of outliers.

name change: axialBd -> axialFactor

How about splines to generate multiple numbers?  A general facility could reduce the number of parameters significantly.  It might even be
interesting to run an antenna with spines for things, then convert to a more general representation to fine tune it.

Breeder to have a fitness threshold for children!
	core, HFC, HillClimbing

Output some measure of population convergance besides fitness standard deviation.  Should be easy enough for antennas.
	Perhaps sum of distance from the best (avoid N^2 problem)

HFC
	QUESTION: should bottom breeder have it's top fitness raised?  We're doing it that way now.

Segments in first cubesat segment.  Where apply feed?  How many?

Test XYZ manufacturing with the first segment exempted

bring frequencies, phi-theta sampling, deck pre-post into antenna?

MutationInsert maximum size

Fix bias toward short genomes in var ops for EvolvableDoubleList

-- xyz manufacturing error issue
	-- have karen take a look (send her stuff to look at)
	-- start not on the first (0) segment, in case x,y variation on end of first segment is the issue.


Simulation studies:
Different segment lengths
Comparison with experiment?

Try XYZ manufacturing errors
	0.00005 ala Greg
	add radius errors? 0.00003 ala greg
What about concatenating runs?  E.g., hill climb after GA?  Create new populations from previous runs?
Immediate: take best from one run to create the population for the next run.


Parallelization and Islanding:

One process (master) runs N populations, each with its own Parameters class.  This class is an RMI server.  Methods:

JavaGenesMaster:
Vector jobs = array of Run objects (get DistributedBreeders and export them)

DistributedBreeder getDistributedBreeder();

DistributedBreeder (must be exported and thread safe)
EvolvableAndFitnessFunction getChild(JavaGenesSlave myself); or do evaluation on master machine
boolean putIndividual(Individual); // returns whether any additional individuals will ever be needed

Evolvable

JaavaGenesSlave
JavaGenesMaster 
void getNewDistributedBreeder()
	JavaGenesMaster.getDistributedBreeder().
