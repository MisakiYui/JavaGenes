JavaGenes is produced and distributed by  NASA under NASA's Open Source Agreement Version 1.3 (NOSA).  The text may be found in NOSA.txt in this directory.

JavaGenes also contains two packages redistributed under their own licenses: Colt and JUnit.  

Colt is a collection of libraries with a variety of open source-like licenses.  See http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/.  JavaGenes only uses a small fraction of the Colt libraries, primarily a random number generator and some String functions.
